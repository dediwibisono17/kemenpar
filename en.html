                <i>The history of tourism in Indonesia dates back to Dutch’s colonial era. Around 1910-1920, the Dutch government established Vereeneging Toesristen Verker (VTV) to facilitate people from Europe who wanted to travel to Indonesia.

            <div class="description__history">
                <p>After Japan’s occupation and Indonesia earned its independence, the Indonesian government began to work hard to boost economy by, among other things, developing tourism industry.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Tourism started to be formally organized in 1959 under the Ministry of Transportation, Post, Telegraph and Telephone which was helmed by Minister Djatikusumo. Djatikusumo served as a minister within President Soekarno’s Working Cabinet until 1963.


                </p>

                <p>
                    For around three decades, the name of the institution tasked to take care of tourism changed several times. The ministers were also changed from Djatikusumo to Hidajat Martaatmadja (1963-1966), Soerjadi Soerjadarma (1966), Hamengkubuwono IX (1966) and
                    S.H. Simatupang (1966).


                </p>

                <p>
                    Throughout the years, Indonesia’s tourism kept growing as shown by the number of foreign tourists which exponentially increased.


                </p>

                <p>
                    In 1969, when there were 86,000 foreign tourists traveled to Indonesia, President Soeharto issued Presidential Instruction No. 9 on Guidance for Supervision of National Tourism Development. Several measures to develop the nation’s tourism were mentioned
                    in the article 4, which are:.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>To maintain the natural beauty and resources as well as the people’s cultures in Indonesia as tourist attractions;
                    </li>
                    <li>To provide facilities such as transportation, accommodation, entertainment and other tourism essential services, including education for regeneration;
                    </li>
                    <li>To actively carry out effective tourism promotion within the country and abroad;
                    </li>
                    <li>To ensure the smoothness of the tourists’ travel formalities and transportation and to eradicate factors that obstruct them;
                    </li>
                    <li>To aim every transportation policy and activity, particularly air transportation, as the main mean to increase the number of tourists.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The following year, in 1970, the government established Bali Tourist Development Corporation (BDTC). Back then, Bali was Indonesia’s pilot project for tourism development because the island received foreign tourists more than any other parts of Indonesia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, the government had also realized that the country’s tourism could not rely only on Bali. Therefore, from 1970 to 1980, Indonesia’s tourism promotion was carried out using jargons like “Indonesia, there is more to it than Bali”, “Indonesia, Bali
                    and Beyond” and “Indonesia, Bali plus Nine.”</p>

                            <p>Before 1983, tourism was managed by a directorate under ministry or department which took care of transportation affairs. In 1983, the government paid more attention to tourism and created Department of Tourism, Post and Telecommunication
                                and appointed Achmad Tahir as the minister.</p>
                            <p>
                                One of the government’s notable policies made during Achmad’s leadership to attract foreigners to visit Indonesia was the Presidential Decree No. 15/1983. The decree stipulated free visa for visitors from 26 countries and mentioned 9 airports and 7 seaports
                                as official gates for foreigners to enter Indonesia
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not only to increase the number of foreign travelers, according to Achmad, the policy also served as a strategic measure to attract investors in investing in the development of tourism facilities. In the future, this measure had opened a wider opportunity
                                for crafters and business owners in tourism sector to spread their wings</p>

                                While serving as Minister of Tourism, Post and Telecommunication, Soesilo Soedarman made a breakthrough by launching the Visit Indonesia Year program in 1991. That year, Indonesia began to intensify its promotion program overseas.

                            <p>
                                Soesilo’s another notable program that is still popular up to this day is the Sapta Pesona. Through a ministerial decree in issued in 1989, he introduced the tourism campaign which is symbolized by a shining sun. The sun has seven components: safe, orderly,
                                clean, cool, beautiful, friendly and memories.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Through this campaign, the government attempted to collaborate with people in developing the nation’s tourism. People who lived in the area of tourist sites were expected to be able to create atmosphere that are safe, orderly, clean, cool because the
                                environment is being taken care of and beautiful. They were also expected to greet the tourists with friendly smile and to help the tourists create great memories while spending times in Indonesia.

                            <p>
                                When Soesilo was in the office, the ministry began to build the Sapta Pesona building – the ministry’s headquarters. The construction commenced on Nov. 20, 1991

                                When Joop Ave served as Minister of Tourism, Post and Telecommunication from 1993-1998, Indonesia’s tourism made some significant developments. According to the National Development Planning Board (Bappenas), within the period 1993/1994 and 1996/1997,
                                the number of foreign tourists visiting Indonesia grew from 3.4 million people to 5.06 million. The amount of foreign exchange also increased from US$ 3.98 billion to US$ 6.34 billion.

                                In doing his job as a minister, Joop Ave was known as a visioner leader that he was even dubbed as Indonesia’s Father of Tourism. He pushed the construction of hotels and convention centers – from which the Meeting, Incentive, Conference and Exhibition
                                industry began to grow. Since then, Indonesia has been actively and sustainably hosting international events.

                            <p>
                                Joop Ave’s love for Indonesia’s culture was beyond measure. He believed that Indonesia’s beautiful nature and culture was a door through which we could introduce our nation overseas.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 1993, Joop Ave alongside Balinese sculpture Nyoman Nuarta initiated the construction of Garuda Wisnu Kencana statue in Jimbaran, Bali. The statue, which was inaugurated in 2018, is now one of Bali’s main tourist destinations.

                                industry. Many countries issued travel ban policies for their citizens to enter Indonesia following the tragedies.

                                Slowly but surely, Indonesia’s tourism industry tried to rise from the crisis. Jero Wacik served as Minister of Culture and Tourism in both of President Soesilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s terms, in the first and second United Indonesia Cabinet.

                                During his first months serving as a minister, Jero Wacik had to lead the country’s tourism to weather another crisis caused by terrorist attack, the second Bali Bombings, in 2005. The tourism industry found its way to survive.

                                In 2008, the ministry relaunched the Visit Indonesia Year program. This was aimed at boosting the number of foreign tourists travelling to the country while at the same time celebrating the commemoration of the 100th National Resurgence Day.

                                With around Rp 200 billion of budget, Jero claimed that the program was a success. He mentioned the amount of foreign exchange received, US$ 7.5 billion, which was beyond the country’s initial target of US$ 6.7 billion.

                                Between Jero’s first and second term, Mohammad Nuh served as an ad-interim Tourism Minister for 20 days. In his second term, Jero took part in pushing UNESCO to recognize keris, wayang, batik, angklung, saman dance, subak as cultural heritage from Indonesia.

                                which were shot in Bali. Adding to that, a France reality show Koh Lanta also did some shootings in Indonesia, to be more precise in Raja Ampat, West Papua.

                                Since he was inaugurated as Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy, Wishnutama revealed to public his main mission in developing tourism in Indonesia. He introduced five super priority tourist destinations, namely Lake Toba in North Sumatra, Mandalika
                                in West Nusa Tenggara, Manado in North Sulawesi, Borobudur in Central Java and Labuan Bajo in East Nusa Tenggara.

                                During his first year as a minister, Wishnutama faced an unprecedented challenge: the COVID-19 pandemic. The ministry had no choice but to halt a lot of tourism development plans.

                            <p>
                                However, mid-2020, the ministry launched the Cleanliness, Health, Safety and Environmental Sustainability (CHSE) program to show how the tourism and creative economy industries have been trying to adapt with the pandemic. The CHSE becomes an important
                                factor in a more sustainable tourism and creative economy development.

                                Hand in hand with this effort, the tourism and creative economy industries are being developed with more quality-oriented approach. In the tourism sector, the ministry has focused on targeting a segment of tourist who spend the most money while traveling
                                in Indonesia. In the creative economy sector, meanwhile, the government is supporting the production of export-quality products.

                    The Tourism Ministry leadership has officially been mandated to Wishnutama Kusubandio in October 2019, replacing his predecessor, Arief Yahya.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the same time, the Ministry of Tourism had officially changed its name to the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy, marking a more synergized development between tourism and creative industry sectors. The two related sectors, if managed better,
                    are believed to have potential to contribute more to Indonesian economy.

                <p>
                    Under Wisnutama’s leadership, Indonesia’s tourism development aims to focus on quality tourism. In many occasions, he mentioned how mportant it is for Indonesia to shift from quantity tourism or mass tourism to quality tourism. From previously pursuing
                    the number of tourist isits, Indonesia heads towards quality tourism that focuses on giving the best and unique experiences for tourists. Quality tourism is believed to be more effective to generate bigger foreign exchange to the country.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “We have to stop talking about quantity tourism and pay more attention to quality tourism. It is quality tourism that will truly bring more foreign exchange to this country and more positive impact to Indonesia. [Through] quality tourism, [we will] care
                    more about cultural conservation and environmental protection,” said Wishnutama in November 2019.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Wishnutama, Indonesia has a lot of potentials to develop quality tourism. One of them is world-class events which are held professionally with creative concepts. World-class event and MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Convention and Exhibition)
                    are proven to attract high-quality and highspending tourists in the last few years in Indonesia. As examples are the 2018 Asian Games and the IMF-World Bank Annual Meeting in Bali in 2018. Thus, world-class event is repared to be
                    one of tourism sector’s priorities in the next five years.
                </p>

            <div class="paragraph-3 wow animate__animated animate__delay-1s animate__fadeIn">
                <p>
                    In the end of 2019, Indonesia also introduced Wellness and Jamu Tourism, which is expected to attract high-spending tourists. Wishnutama said that Wellness Tourism is a unique concept that offers Indonesian local wisdom through Indonesia’s herbal drink,
                    jamu, and traditional spa. It offers tourists with high-quality tourism experience.
                </p>


                <p class="wow animate__animated animate__delay-1s animate__fadeIn">
                    The development of tourism village and ecotourism that accentuates environment sustainability is also potential to be developed as the driver for quality tourism. The Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy aims to develop more tourism villages which
                    prioritize sustainability as well as cultural and environmental conservation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the COVID-19 pandemic, the development of quality tourism has become more relevant and essentials. In the future, tourism trend is projected to shift to focus more to sustainable tourism from previously mass tourism. Sustainable tourism emphasizes
                    on the carrying capacity of tourism destination and enables tourists to maintain their distance from one another. Tourists are also predicted to prefer nature tourism and attractions with exciting experience, all of which are conducted
                    in compliance with health protocol.

                    Under Wishnutama’s administration, the pandemic became a momentum for the tourism sector to improve its quality especially in hygiene and health aspects. The Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy now requires all tourism destinations and tourism business
                    owners to comply with the value of the Cleanliness, Health, Safety and Environmental Sustainability (CHSE) in the new normal era as a form of adaptation during the pandemic. The CHSE program is implemented in various tourism accommodations
                    from hotels, restaurant, tourist lodges, tourism villages, gold field, rafting provider, to diving provider.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The implementation of the CHSE program aims to award the business players in tourism sector with CHSE certification if they comply with the protocol. The certification will serve as a guarantor for tourists and visitors that the product and service provided
                    by the certificate holder have complied with the CHSE value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With the CHSE certification, people would not need to feel worry while traveling as tourists. That being said, the CHSE becomes a very important factor for the development of the quality tourism during this COVID-19 pandemic and even after it. Alongside
                    the CHSE program, the ministry also launched a set of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which is a mandatory for stakeholders in the tourism industry and creative economy sectors from hotels, restaurant to tourism attractions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the creative economy sector, the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy also introduces a movement called #BeliKreatifLokal or BuyLocalCreative. The movement aims to support entrepreneurs or small and medium business enterprises in creative industry
                    such as fashion, culinary and craft to revive their business from the pandemic impact.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the #BeliKreatifLokal movement, the ministry collaborates with a number of partners such as Blibli, Gojek, Grab, Bukalapak, Tokopedia, Shopee, Blue Bird and Kontak Hukum. Supports provided through the BeliKreatifLokal movement includes product delivery
                    using on-demand platform such as Gojek and Grab and product sales through online marketplace such as Tokopedia and Bukalapak. Under this movement, people within the creative industry are also entitled to assistance for co-branding
                    and for legal consultancy to establish their business legality.

                    Amidst the pandemic, the development of priority tourism destinations continues to take place. The constructions of facilities and access in the five super priority tourism destinations is taking place in Labuan Bajo, Borobudur, Toba Lake, Mandalika and
                    Likupang. The five super priority destinations are expected to be the driver for Indonesian tourism development in the future

                    Tourism and Creative Economy Ministry holds three main mandates in the current administration namely 1) Increasing foreign exchange from tourism sector, 2) Increasing the tourism sector contribution to national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 3) Increasing
                    the export value of creative industry products.

                    Tourism and creative industry sectors are believed to be able to contribute more to the national GDP with its huge potential. Not only Indonesia has abundant beautiful natural tourist sites, it is also rich in cultural diversity and local wisdom from
                    traditional culinary, music, art to performances. With more than 199 traditional dances, 724 traditional languages and 1,340 ethnicities, Indonesia has a lot to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Product diversification and tourism destinations outside Bali which are now being developed will definitely become an effective strategy to attract more tourists to Indonesia. Simultaneously, the creative economy sector surrounding the tourism industry
                    is also expected to develop, especially with the construction of Special Economic Zone for tourism in Indonesia.

                        The logo has changed several times throughout the years. The changes do not occur to the shape of the bird which act as the icon, but to the words “Visit Indonesia” or “Wonderful Indonesia”.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Initially, the “Visit Indonesia” words were located beneath the bird’s left wing. In the end 201, when the government replaced the “Visit Indonesia” program to “Wonderful Indonesia”, the words were changed to “Wonderful Indonesia” and located in the same
                        position.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From 2012 to 2014, the “Wonderful Indonesia” words were moved to the right side of the bird’s tail. In 2016, the position was changed to the right side of the bird’s body. In 2018, it was once again repositioned to the right side of the bird’s wing. The
                        logo is used until today.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2020, Tourism and Creative Economy Minister Wishnutama Kusubandio decided to replace the logo for this time being. The decision was made as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic that affected tourism in Indonesia and all over the world.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        The “Wonderful Indonesia” logo is temporarily changed to “Thoughtful Indonesia”. However, Wishnutama made it clear that nothing is change with Indonesia’s main tourism branding. The “Thoughtful Indonesia” logo is introduced as a basis to launch thoughtful
                        programs for those in the tourism and creative economy industries that are affected by the crises caused by the pandemic.
